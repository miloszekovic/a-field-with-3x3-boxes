# a-field-with-3x3-boxes

All boxes are square and equal sized. 
The resulting big box is also square, centered, and has a 100% screen height. 
The numbers within the boxes are also centered, vertically and horizontally.
The resulting box always fills 100% of the available screen size - desktop and mobile, landscape and portrait.

Result: CSS GRID + vmin
